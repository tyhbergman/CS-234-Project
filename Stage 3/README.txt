COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS FOR TEA SHOP SOFTWARE ON WINDOWS

1.) Once the download for the ZIP file from https://github.com/tyhbergman/CS-234-Project is complete, 
	navigate to its location in the file explorer.

2.) Right click on the ZIP file and select the "Extract Here" option. This should create a folder 
	named "CS-234-Project-main" in the same location as the ZIP file.

3.) Open the folder "CS-234-Project-main" and navigate to the folder "TeaShop_NA_TB_LG", and then from
	there open the folder "src". 

4.) For Windows: Once opened, type "cmd" in the address bar at the top of File Explorer and press enter. This should open a
	command line window.
    For Mac: Once opened, make sure the correct directory is reflected in the terminal and before 
	attempting to compile.

5.) Type "javac MainMenu.java" and press enter. This will compile every .java file in the "src" folder since 
	MainMenu.java contains the main method.

6.) Finally, if compilaton was succesful, type "java MainMenu" and press enter to run the Tea Shop Software.
